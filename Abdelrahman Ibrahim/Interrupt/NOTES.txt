Each interrupt in the microcontroller has a specific indicator bit called peripheral interrupt flag (PIF).
This bit is set to 1 when the interrupt happens whatever the interrupt was enabled or disabled.

In Maskable interrupts, another bit exist called peripheral interrupt Enable (PIE).
When Maskable happens, its PIF is set to 1. If its PIE was set to 1, then the interrupt
would be served.
If not, the processor would continue its normal code execution.

In Non-Maskable interrupts, there is no PIE. 
Whenever the interrupt happens, it is being served. 


Global Interrupt Enable (GIE).
When this bit is 0, All maskable interrupt are disabled whatever the PIE was 1 or 0.
But when this bit is set to 1, it allows the maskable interrupt to happen if its PIE is set to 1 too.
Remember
The Non- Maskable interrupts have no PIE and the GIE doesnâ€™t affect them. 
These interrupts when happen, they must be served !
